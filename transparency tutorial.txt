As thedaian mentioned in his comment, converting the magenta pixels to transparent in JavaScript is going to be slow. You should convert your images to a suitable format beforehand.

ImageMagick can be really useful for this kind of tasks. Converting your tile with magenta background to an image with transparency is as simple as this:

convert myOpaqueTile.png -transparent "#FF00FF" myTransparentTile.png
This will convert your file with magenta background (myOpaqueTile.png) to a file with a transparent background (will be saved as myTransparentTile.png).

Of course you could also use Photoshop, GIMP or something like Paint.NET for this.
